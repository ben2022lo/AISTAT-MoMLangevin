# StocStochastic MoM-Gradient Langevin Dynamics
This repository contains the implementation of our Stochastic MoM-Gradient Langevin Dynamics, as described in our conference paper. 
To reproduce the results from the paper, run the experiments.py script.
If you want to test our method on a different dataset, you can modify the data laoding and processing in data.py.
